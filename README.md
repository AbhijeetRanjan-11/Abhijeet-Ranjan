**🛠️ Projects:**  
## Firewall Security System (Python, Java, Azure, AI) - It is on Progress
- Developed a web-based firewall application using XML-based data transmission and API integrations.
- Implemented core functionality in Python and Java.
- Integrated cloud services using Microsoft Azure and explored AI techniques for intelligent threat detection.
  
## Advanced Caesar Cipher AES Image Encryptor
- The application supports both classic Caesar cipher encryption for text and advanced AES encryption for images (at both file and pixel levels), making it versatile for different types of data security.
- Uses secure password-based key derivation (PBKDF2 with salt) and multiple AES modes (CBC, GCM, ECB) for robust image encryption and decryption, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
- Built with Tkinter, the GUI allows easy interaction for selecting files, entering passwords, choosing encryption modes, and viewing results, making complex encryption accessible to all users.

## Scalable Big Data Analytics of Real-Time Fraud Detection (Python, ML, Spark, Hadoop)
- Developed an advanced fraud detection system using Python and machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow),achieving high accuracy and low false-positive rates for real-time credit card transaction analysis.
- Leveraged big data technologies such as Apache Spark and Hadoop to process and analyze large-scale transaction datasets, enabling scalable and efficient real-time fraud detection.
- Implemented feature engineering and real-time monitoring techniques, integrating supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, ensemble methods) to enhance system robustness and minimize financial risk.
  
## Design and Development of an Efficient and Intelligent Weather Forecasting App (HTML, CSS, JS,Bootstrap, OpenWeatherMap API)
- Developed a web-based weather forecasting app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on user input (location, season, and sunlight levels).
- Enabled weather insights for remote areas by optimizing API queries and UI responsiveness.
